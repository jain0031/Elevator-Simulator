# Elevator-Simulator
1.Design Patterns
a. Model View Controller is implemented properly. Easy mark as the structure is given.
b. Observer pattern, Observable and Observer are properly assigned to their right classes.
2. Class called ElevatorApplication which extends Application. This is JavaFX GUI.
3. Class Simulator in ElevatorApplication to start simulation of elevator travelling.
4. ElevatorApplication implements Observer and ElevatorImp extends Observable.
5. Only one elevator is available for this simulator.
6. Elevator will start from floor zero and has a capacity of one person.
7. Elevator consumes energy
a. One kilowatt (kW) is consumed for each full floor travel
b. Two kilowatt (kW) is consumed for each start and stop.
8.Error Handling
